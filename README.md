# Camera Calculator

<<<<<<< HEAD
This v2.0 is in production. Here is what coming so far:

 - Re-written in Nuxtjs (Vue), Vue-Bootstrap
 - Updated UI, much simpler and cleaner
 - New light data
 - Using JSON as database

I don't have all the time in the world. I will be working on this project on my spare time.
=======
This is actually an impromptu project on my curiosity at calculating something for film camera. As you know (*or you might don't know*), there're no online camera calculator out there yet that can calculate some of camera's settings like ISO, aperture, FPS, or even foot candle. (*Except ARRI's photometric data, but it's just calculating their light*). 

**So I made one!**

## Features
 - Calculate foot candle and lux from aperture, fps, and iso 
 - Calculate aperture from fps, iso, and foot candle/lux
 - Calculate foot candle and lux from certain distance with certain lights
 - Calculate focal length you need with another sensor from full-frame

## Environmental support
Runs on anything that could open an HTML page with CSS and JavaScript support. 

## Development
In the future I'll add some more, but I don't know what it'll be, yet.
If you want to contribute, feel free! It's an open source project.
