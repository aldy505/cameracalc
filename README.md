# Camera Calculator
This is actually an impromptu project on my curiosity at calculating something for film camera. As you know (*or you might don't know*), there is no free online camera calculator out there yet that can calculate some of camera's settings like ISO, aperture, FPS, or even footcandle. (*Except ARRI's photometric data, but it's just calculating their light*). **So I made one!**

Rendered HTML source code: [here](https://github.com/aldy505/cameracalc/tree/production)
Database of Photometrics and Camera sensor data (that you can mess around): [here](https://github.com/aldy505/cameracalc/tree/json-db)

## Features
- Calculate footcandle and lux from aperture, fps, and iso
- Calculate aperture from fps, iso, and foot candle/lux
- Calculate footcandle and lux from certain distance with certain lights
- Calculate focal length equivalent from some camera to another camera

## Environmental support
Runs on anything that could open an HTML page with CSS and JavaScript support.


## Development
I want to add some other features, but either I don't know what that is or I don't know how to implement it yet.
Please feel free to put any request on [issues](https://github.com/aldy505/cameracalc/issues).

  

## Changelog

Please refer to the [changelog](https://github.com/aldy505/cameracalc/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for detailed information.
