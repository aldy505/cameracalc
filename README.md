# Camera Calculator

This is actually an impromptu project on my curiosity at calculating something for film camera. As you know (*or you might don't know*), there're no online camera calculator out there yet that can calculate some of camera's settings like ISO, aperture, FPS, or even foot candle. (*Except ARRI's photometric data, but it's just calculating their light*). 

**So I made one!**

## Features
 - Calculate foot candle and lux from aperture, fps, and iso 
 - Calculate aperture from fps, iso, and foot candle/lux

## Environmental support
Runs on anything that could open an HTML page with CSS and JavaScript support. 

## Development
In the future I'll add some more, like you can calculate some light photometrics or calculate some things inside your camera.
If you want to contribute, feel free! It's an open source project.
